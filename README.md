# Stanford Cars Classification Using ResNet50 with Progressive Unfreezing

This exercise tackles the **Stanford Cars Dataset** using **ResNet50** for fine-grained car model classification.  
The task involves recognizing **196 distinct car models** through transfer learning and **progressive unfreezing**.

To improve transfer learning performance, the model is fine-tuned in **three stages** instead of unfreezing the entire network at once:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;☢️ **Stage 1:** Train only the classifier head and deep layers  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;☢️ **Stage 2:** Unfreeze mid-level layers  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;☢️ **Stage 3:** Unfreeze the early backbone layers  

Higher-level features adapt first while preserving stable low-level ones, reducing the risk of *catastrophic forgetting*.

## **Task Objectives**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚡ Create an ideal training/validation split from the original training set    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚡ Keep the official test set untouched until the final model evaluation     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚡ Visualize the dataset for insights on car model distribution and image content  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚡ Explore target labels so we can identify class imbalances or other patterns     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚡ Perform a multi-stage training procedure with progressive unfreezing of layers  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚡ Apply data augmentation to improve generalization and reduce overfitting  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚡ Evaluate model performance using top-1 accuracy, precision, recall, and f1

## **Results**

### **With Validation Split**

| Metric | Value |
|---------|--------|
| **Loss** | 1.3082 |
| **Accuracy** | 0.9117 |
| **Precision** | 0.9134 |
| **Recall** | 0.9117 |
| **F1-Score** | 0.9110 |
| **Inference Time** | 00:01:37 |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🦦 The setup achieves top-1 accuracy of 91.17%    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🦦 We have taken 10% of the training set for validation   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🦦 We can improve accuracy (and other metrics) slighly above current if we use the training set in its entirety.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🦦 However, we refrain from using the test set until the final eval.    

### **Without a Validation Split**

🦦 The current setup has best top-1 accuracy of 91.67% (made on Stage 3)    
🦦 The bulk of meaningful tuning happened in Stage 1, where only the fc and layer4 layers are trainable  
🦦 Stages 2 and 3 oscillated and provided little contributions to the validation metrics that seem to be already at near peak after Stage 1    
🦦 Looking at the graphs, the model fitted the training set but still generalizes okay to the validation (test) set with consistent accuracy gaps  
🦦 The gap between training and test accuracies is consistent throughout Stages 2 and 3 at ~0.08 to ~0.09
